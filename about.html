	   <h1>Implementation of Augmented Reality</h1>
	   <h2>Introduction</h2>
	   <p>
	   Remember when augmented reality seemed only like some crazy sci-fi idea from the Matrix back in 1999? Yeah, it seemed like a 
	   dream. However, that dream isnâ€™t much of a dream anymore, its real and its slowly creeping its way into the lives of people. 
	   Many uses of augmented reality have been developed and possibilities of positive and negative effects are shifting the industry 
	   down an uncertain future. Here we will be discussing some of the uses and effects of augmented reality in our current day.
