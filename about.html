		   We use an internet hosting service known as <i>GitHub</i> to host our website. We have created HTML and CSS files that are hosted within the <i>GitHub</i> service to hold all of our templates and formatting. The text you are currently reading is held within a hosted HTML file that is being accessed directly using their hosting services. The domain "tsamlec.com" is accessible by the domain hosting company <i>GoDaddy Inc.</i> and has been set to redirect to these hosted HTML and CSS files. Our one CSS file contains formatting regarding the navigation header at the top of each page, and there is one HTML file per each page's formatting.
