	   <h1>Implementation of Augmented Reality</h1>
	   <h2>Introduction</h2>
	   <p>
	   Remember when augmented reality seemed only like some crazy sci-fi idea from the Matrix back in 1999? Yeah, it seemed like a 
	   dream. However, that dream isnâ€™t much of a dream anymore, its real and its slowly creeping its way into the lives of people. 
	   Many uses of augmented reality have been developed and possibilities of positive and negative effects are shifting the industry 
	    down an uncertain future. Here we will be discussing some of the uses and effects of augmented reality in our current day.

	   <h2>Recreational Uses</h2>
	   <p>
	   The video game industry is probably the first thing you think of when you hear about the topic of virtual reality. The well-known Oculus Rift, a virtual reality headset, started the trend of augmented reality games. It created an opportunity for a brand-new genre of games that opened a new 3D environment that could be explored all within your room. In the first small steps of the development process, developers have already began developing more and more games where you can actually travel whether it be a controller due to limited space or your actual feet.  
	   </p>
	   <h2>Educational Uses</h2>
	   <p>
	   With the augmented reality industry growing large, schools have begun taking advantage of the situation and have begun applying it into their own classrooms. A device known as Leap Motion, uses Motion Capture which allow the user to manipulate objects using virtually generated hands that recognize your real hand movements. Certain types of special education, like architectural design and engineering, can highly benefit from this technological device that allows them to mess around with their environment in a much simpler and faster way.

	   <h2>Commercial Uses</h2>
	   <p>
	  People are finding new ingenious ways to integrate augmented reality in the products they sell. One big example could be the gaming company, Nintendo, who developed products called AR Cards back around after their portable gaming device, the 3DS, was released. The AR Cards are cards that have images of characters from many of their developed game franchises. However, using the camera of the 3DS and aiming it at a card will virtually generate the character and have them positioned on the card in an augmented reality (some of them even do some small movements), but can only be seen through the camera always.

	   <h2>Concerns of the Future</h2>
	   <p>
	   Augmented reality is growing, and some say its growing fast. Maybe in a few years from now, many of our classrooms will require us to wear visors and have a virtual person teach us. Perhaps we will be walking down the streets of a city, then slip on some new augmented glasses and bam! We see arrows and signs in the sky telling us where everything is. In fact, it may even be possible to generate an exact replica of a human with one scan that we can research in our enclosed augmented environment. However, will we get this far with augmented reality? Who knows? It all lies in the imaginations of the developers. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The biggest problem that people see with augmented reality is how it will affect the way they will perceive things in the world around them. Devices being used in the real world such as Google Glass displays information that blocks little of your vision. However, that little obscurity can cause a misjudgment in the real world, like the lights at a crossing. Some devices may impair your other senses such as your hearing which could potentially prevent you from hearing an upcoming car. Either way, little distractions or impairments like these may have augmented reality device developers on their toes when they design more products in the future.
