		<h2>Information Technology Academy</h2>
		<p>
			Companies, schools and most homes have computers, networks, web sites and electronic devices that rely on 
			technology to process and use information. The Information Technology Academy is an exciting learning 
			community that provides students with technical knowledge and skills for employment in computer 
			technology by offering three Career Pathway choices:<br /> 
				• Computer Systems Technology (Cisco Networking)<br />
		    		• Electronic Technology<br />
		   		• Web Design Technology<br />
			This is the perfect academy for students who love 
			computers, electronic gadgets, working with their hands, and anything to do with technology.	
		</p>
		<br />
		<h3>Electronic Technology</h3>
		<p>
			Electronics is the core building block for every area of technology today. Electronic Technology 
			trains students for employment as service, assembly, and/or installation technicians in the 
			electronics industry.  Students gain general knowledge in all electronic areas, including Avionics, 
			Digital Technician, and Communication Technician.  Students assemble electronic circuits, 
			use soldering techniques, design and construct amplifier and digital/microprocessor circuits, and build radios.
		</p>
		<br />
		<h3>IT Network Administrator (Cisco)</h3>
		<p>
			Since computers and networks impact our lives daily, careers in computer networking are among the 
			highest in demand and salary today. The Cisco Networking Academy is an exciting industry-supported program 
			leading to certification in CCNA (Certified Cisco Network Associate) and successful careers in Computer 
			Technologies, Network Administration, and Network Engineering.  The program teaches computer hardware and 
			software, network design/deployment/ management, with state-of-the-art real-world equipment such as routers, 
			switches and servers used to connect the world.
		</p>
		<br />
		<h3>Web Design</h3>
		<p>
			Most companies market their products and services by establishing web sites that are exciting, eye catching and 
			user friendly. Web Development provides the technical knowledge and skills for employment in Web Site Design and 
			Management.  Students learn application and developer tools such as the Adobe Photoshop, Flash, Dreamweaver, and 
			WordPress. Creatively plan, develop, and publish well-designed web sites combining effective navigation with graphics, 
			text, color, and multimedia.  Our Web Design students design sites for teachers and industry.
		</p>
		<br />
		<h2>Clubs</h2>
		<p>
			Technology Student Association (TSA), VEX Robotics and Battle Bots, and Society of Hispanic 
			Professional Engineers (SHPE) are all hosted by the leader of the Cambridge Engineering section, 
			Paul Kynerd.
			
			Our work area contains a lab area located at the front of the classroom armed with computers in a 
			3-row setup. The back is the hands-on area where students get to work and demonstrate the physical 
			aspects of the engineering process.
