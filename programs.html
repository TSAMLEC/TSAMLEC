		<br />
		<h2>Cambridge</h2>
		<p>
			The Cambridge Academy is part of the University of International Examinations (CIE), 
			the worldâ€™s leading provider of academic and technical qualifications internationally. 
			Designed to develop highly successful students globally, the CIE also features the 
			Advanced International Certification of Education (AICE) which provides a 
			pre-college/university curriculum that emphasizes the importance of broad study for those
			who are eligible. Our school, Miami Lakes Educational Center, has the Cambridge Academy 
			available with an AICE curriculum.
		</p>
		<br />
		<h2>Engineering</h2>
		<p>
			Purpose is to give students the foundation of knowledge and technological experiences 
			oriented in the application of engineering, how it affects our lives and the importance 
			of choosing our future careers. The program focuses on work-related skills and stresses 
			the understanding and demonstration of technical machines, instruments, materials, 
			processes, and systems in the engineering business/industry. Students are able to earn 
			multiple certifications that include: Certified Solidworks Associate (CSWA), Certified
			SolidWorks Professional (CSWP), and the Mastercam Associate certification.

		<h2>Clubs</h2>
		<p>
			Technology Student Association (TSA), VEX Robotics and Battle Bots, and Society of Hispanic 
			Professional Engineers (SHPE) are all hosted by the leader of the Cambridge Engineering section, 
			Paul Kynerd.
			
			Our work area contains a lab area located at the front of the classroom armed with computers in a 
			3-row setup. The back is the hands-on area where students get to work and demonstrate the physical 
			aspects of the engineering process.
