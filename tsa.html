	    	Our TSA chapter prides itself in the enthusiasm our students share in the STEM and engineering fields. We have a triad of Engineering clubs: SHPE JR (Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers), TSA (Technology Student Association), and Robotics (VEX and Battle Bots). These clubs work in union to encourage student engagement. Shown here, we have something at our school known as "Club Rush" to present our clubs to students and recruit members for the new year.
