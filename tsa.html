	    <h2>Silver Achievement Awards</h2>
	    <p>
	    	Members of our TSA Chapter are required to participate in the Achievement Program designed to motivate and recognize members of the chapter for putting high amounts of effort into their school’s technology program. The program helps encourage students develop good attitudes, overall general knowledge, and leadership skills through their competition events.
		For members of the chapter to go to states, it is mandatory for individuals to achieve the Silver level of the program (Lowest being Bronze, second Silver, highest Gold). Students must select activities under four categories – Leadership Development – (LD); Understanding Technology - (UT); School/Community Service - (SC); and Career/Personal Planning - (CP) – to gain points that will display their efforts into earning their respective award level.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    	Our TSA chapter prides itself in the enthusiasm our students share in the STEM and engineering fields. We have a triad of Engineering clubs: SHPE JR (Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers), TSA (Technology Student Association), and Robotics (VEX and Battle Bots). These clubs work in union to encourage student engagement. Shown here, we have something at our school known as "Club Rush" to present our clubs to students and recruit members for the new year.
